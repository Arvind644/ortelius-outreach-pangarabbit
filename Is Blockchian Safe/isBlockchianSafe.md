# Is Blockchian Safe?

Without getting into details of security, let’s spend a few minutes knowing Blockchain better. You might already know what Blockchain is, but most of the time we see people using “cryptocurrency” and “blockchain” interchangeably. It is not their fault. Cryptocurrencies have been so much glamourized that we don’t see the difference between crypto and blockchain anymore. It has been found that the proportion of scientific papers about Bitcoin to the papers about other blockchain application possibilities is around 4:1. Bitcoin grew more than 60 000 times since it appeared, and it is one of the main reasons for blockchain's current popularity. Blockchain is the technology behind these cryptocurrencies, but the application is not limited to just digital currencies. As the name suggests blockchain consists of blocks that are added one after the other. The data is not centralized and there is no central authority. The Blockchain is like an implementation of distributed database, where each block of data has a transaction and the hash pointer for the next block. These hashes are generated by algorithms which is why you cannot insert a block in between or delete it because in that case, the hashes will not match. In this blog, we are going to know about how blockchain as a technology works. We will look at the most important features of this technology and security challenges. The idea is to provide the reader with enough details so that he/she can himself/herself decide if blockchain is safe or not.

## Features of Blockchain

We cannot comment on the security of any technology without understanding its details. So, let us unwrap different layers of this technology and understand the advantages and security concerns that they bring. Blockchain works on three fundamental principles: -

Distributed Network - The data in the blockchain is stored in a distributed ledger (distributed data structure) which uses TCP/IP protocol for communicating between its P2P network members. The changes made to this network are immutable and hence can not be deleted or updated after creation. Although researchers feel there is a lot of work needs to be done to standardize the definition for these, however Hileman & Rauchs offer a definition, where the distributed ledger is described as a type of distributed database that can have different users (nodes), and blockchain, in turn, is a type of distributed ledger, which is created like a chain of cryptographically linked ‘blocks’ with transactions and is sending all data to all nodes in its network.

Cryptography – It provides secure and tamper-proof record-keeping of digital transactions. It forms a strong security foundation in transactions. The unique cryptographic hashes are generated to identify each recorded transaction which uses secure algorithms. On the other hand, Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of transactions on the blockchain. They are created using a private key and can only be verified by using the corresponding public key. The private keys are often encrypted with the AES algorithm to prevent unauthorized access, and data may be encrypted to ensure confidentiality.

Consensus – It means validating the transaction before creating it. Cryptography is used in consensus as well. This avoids any unauthorized members from participating in transactions. A consensus mechanism can be simply fully automated or might also be complicated with some manual intervention. This acts like a watch guard for your transactions before actual writes happen. 

## Security Threats in Blockchain

Although we are talking about security using cryptography, but are these algorithms safe? With advancements in technology and more work around quantum computing, there is speculation that these algorithms can be deciphered within seconds. Also, any vulnerability or backdoor found in any of these algorithms will have a direct impact; just like in the case of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. 

Let’s look at a few of the common use cases that are being solved using blockchain. We cannot deny the fact that most of the adoption of blockchain we see is in the banking and financial sector. This might be due to the popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that gained a lot of attraction after 2016. The others would like to use it mainly as a global software execution platform for smart contracts. But with some concrete use cases in other sectors like healthcare, IOT, Real-Estate, and government systems, blockchain has proved its value. Since the range of usage is broad, we will see mixed concerns about the product as well. For some data, privacy, and authenticity would matter but for some, they would be introducing transparency in their system with blockchain security. The difference between one product to other can be as big as architectural design or might be just a change in algorithms for cryptography. The validation of the block creation also varies depending on the use case. The bug in the consensus mechanism can allow unwanted participants in the network and hence data can be compromised in the federated blockchain. 

## Conclusion: -

Currently, we see the usage of blockchain in almost all domains. A few of the popular ones have been captured by Kaspars Zīle and Renāte Strazdiņa in their white paper “Blockchain Use Cases and Their Feasibility”.  Even though the blockchain has a strong security foundation with data encryption, cryptography, and consensus, the safety of using blockchain purely depends on how it has been implemented. The application of blockchain could be a little challenging when you use it without considering all its features of it. If you don’t want an immutable transaction or don’t know how to manage decentralized data, adding security layers to your system might be difficult and hence making it vulnerable. There are several technical aspects like the integrity of network participants, consensus mechanism, preserving the confidentiality of users, and safety of the used encryption algorithms, which will determine the safety of the System. Blockchain needs standardization of processes and whatever blockchain you use, its various components should be continuously maintained to avoid and backdoor into the system due to the vulnerability. In a conclusion, the blockchain is safe until we do not detect any flaw in any of its components. And anything of that sort will create the system unsafely.
