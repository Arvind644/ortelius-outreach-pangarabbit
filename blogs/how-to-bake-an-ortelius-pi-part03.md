 ## How to bake an Ortelius Pi Part 2 | The Preparation

### Introduction

In [Part 2](https://ortelius.io/blog/2024/03/27/how-to-bake-an-ortelius-pi-part-2-the-preperation/), of this series we installed Ubuntu Server 22.04.4 LTS on our Raspberry Pis. In Part 3 we will prepare our three Pis for DHCP, DNS, NFS (Network File System) storage with a [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/) and install [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/).

### NSF CSI Driver



### Traefik the Cloud Native Proxy



### Ortelius the Ultimate Evidence Store




### Conclusion

By this stage you should have three Pi's each ready with the NFS CSI Driver, Traefik and Ortelius up and running. Stay tuned for part 3 where we will deploy [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/), deploy the NSF [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs) for Kubernetes, deploy [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) and [Ortelius](https://ortelius.io/)
