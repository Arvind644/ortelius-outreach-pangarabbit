## Peeling the SecOps Onion

![peeling-the-onion](images/peeling-the-onion.png)

How do you peel an onion? Normally, you would peel an onion layer for layer and that's precisely what Ortelius can do for you minus the crying bit. The security landscape is treacherous as we have witnessed all kinds of malware and ransomware maliciously abusing individuals and organisations for selfish gain. Do you know what packages and dependencies your applications are using? Do you even need all those packages or dependencies? How do we know what to report on? Well lets breakdown some areas where Ortelius can help you peel this onion minus the crying. I am going to use Dev Containers as the example here as I am rather passionate about this way of engineering.

Since there is a strong push towards Platform Engineering a Platform Team can provide approved CISO/SecOps development containers with all the tools, packages and dependencies needed to develop that specific application. Whilst Dev Containers are nothing new they allow engineers to get up and running very quickly with minimal energy being expounded in the setup process especially for new joiners to the team. Access to these Dev Containers can be isolated with minimal communication links, securely configured and made highly available with the use of Kubernetes. Combine Kubernetes with one of my absolute favourite tools [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/) from Loft Labs and you have a super powerful solution in making this a reality.

Now this is where Ortelius like the black box in a aeroplane could consume every piece of information generated by this process and store it in a database. With the use of powerful dashboarding, search and reporting capabilites Ortelius will reveal every inch of your Dev Container universe and give you the power to make quick decisions, remediations or alert Platform Teams to dangerously vulnerable packages and dependencies. So the next time your Team gets asked "Do you know what ingredients are baked into your container cake?" you can answer with confidence and assure your leaders and teammates.

Ortelius can provide the following and so much more:
- Attestation/Provenance
- Open-Source Dependencies
- Licensing
- Vulnerabilities
- Configuration
- Federate Reporting
- Available ingredients
- Exposure and impact
- Application SBOMs
- Zero Trust Data
- Inventory
- History


## Conclusion
With Ortelius firmly cemented in your environment you can take the blind folds off your application universe and root out the so called weeds and ensure you have the safest possible environment at your disposal. Ortelius can address the requirements with the implementation of the [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) framework. SLSA and onions it all makes sense now. I wish you safe computing and minimal tears as you peel away the layers of the onion.
