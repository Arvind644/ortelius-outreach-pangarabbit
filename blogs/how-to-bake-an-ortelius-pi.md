## Introduction




## Conclusion
With Ortelius firmly cemented in your environment you can take the blind folds off your application universe and root out the so called weeds and ensure you have the safest possible environment at your disposal. Ortelius can go a long way to address the requirements of implementing the [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) framework. SLSA and onions it all makes sense now. I wish you safe computing and minimal tears as you peel away the layers of the onion.
